# React-JsonSchema-Form Application

This is a basic application that displays a form selector page for the four assessment report forms.

The user first selects one of the forms by clicking on a button on the side of the page. The user then inputs information into the form. On submission, a JSON string of the user's form data is displayed back to them in a browser alert.

# How To Use The Application

1. Clone the react-jsonschema-form folder
2. cd react-jsonschema-form
3. npm install
4. npm start
5. Application will run on browser at localhost:3000

# Release Notes

## Milestone 5

This version of the react-jsonschema-form application represents the final design of the four forms.

The Non-Accredited Graduate Form autofills with example form data
from a Mathematics assessment report from 2020-2021.
