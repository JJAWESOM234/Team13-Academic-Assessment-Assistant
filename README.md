# Academic-Assessment-Assistant

The purpose of this project is to explore various form auto generation libraries.
These libraries are:
  - [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io/)
  - [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/)
  - [jQuery JSON Form](https://plugins.jquery.com/jsForm/)
  - [react-jsonschema-form](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/)

Each library has a separate application in this repo.
  
## How To Use It

To use the applications, clone the entire repository. Follow the instrusctions of the README.md of 
each project in order to run them.

## Release Notes

### Milestone 1
Each application takes a JSON schema for the Non-Accredited Graduate Assessment report and uses the
respesctive library to auto generate a form. On completing the form, the applications output the user's input as a JSON string.

Each application besides JSON Forms(React) allows users to add and subtract SLO entries, assessment methods, etc.

### Milestone 2
Each application now reads a JSON schema for each of the four assessment reports and auto generates the respective forms.
Each application allows users to add and subtract SLO entries, assessment methods, etc.
Users can easily switch between forms, enter information, and receive that form's output back to them on submitting the form.
