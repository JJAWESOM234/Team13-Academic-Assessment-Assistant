Each library has a separate application in this repo.
  
## How To Use It

each project in order to run them.

## Release Notes

### Milestone 1
Each application takes a JSON schema for the Non-Accredited Graduate Assessment report and uses the
respesctive library to auto generate a form. On completing the form, the applications output the user's input as a JSON string.

Each application besides JSON Forms(React) allows users to add and subtract SLO entries, assessment methods, etc.
